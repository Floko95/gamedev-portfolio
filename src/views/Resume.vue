    <h1>Resume</h1>

    <div class="paragraph">
      I'm <strong>Florian Kotecki</strong>, a gameplay programmer with 5 years of experience.
      <br />After graduating from kindergarten, I've been enrolled in the army for 25 years, where I learned to destroy things in an amazing number of ways.
      <br />I joined the Delta Force because I thought it was Greek lessons, but I quickly adapted to this unexpected environment and became a key element.
      <br />I love teamwork, but I can also go in solo depending on the mission requirements.
      <br />
      <br />Right now I'm trying to find inner peace after I've read some personal development books. I'm looking for a job so if you have any opportunity feel free to 
      <router-link to="/contact">contact me</router-link>.
      <br />
      <br />Besides war, I'm passionate about firearms, martial arts, explosions, push-ups and flowers.
