    <h1>Resume</h1>

    <div class="paragraph">
      I'm <strong>Florian Kotecki</strong>, a gameplay programmer with 5 years of experience.
      <br />I'm a Game Dev, straight out of IT engineering school.
      <br />A confirmed troglodyte gamer, I've developed the critical thinking skills that detect a juicy and fun game. <br>
      <br />So I became an expert on Unity and Unreal to be able to express my passions, which resulted in over 200M Downloads on mobile.
      <br>
      <br />I love the meticulousness, the patience, the pressure, and the dopamine rush that the job brings.
      <br />I have a deep passion for project architecture and design patterns, which allow all the features to be linked together and enable designer-friendly juiciness in an optimal time frame, while facilitating the import of features and design tools into other projects. I also have a codebase for a few personal projects that proves to be quite handful.
